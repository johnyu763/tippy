## Notes

In the process of making this app, I had some minor issues. The most notable was implementing color options. In order to create the background of my app, I had to play around to find out which colors look good together. And I had to gain an understanding of layers such that the UI overlaps with the gradient. Overall, my problems stemmed from inexperience and were easily solved by searching for gaps in my knowledge.
