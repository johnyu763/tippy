## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [X] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Background gradient
- [X] Settings to change color of pages in app

## Notes

In the process of making this app, I had some minor issues. The most notable was implementing color options. In order to create the background of my app, I had to play around to find out which colors look good together. And I had to gain an understanding of layers such that the UI overlaps with the gradient. Overall, my problems stemmed from inexperience and were easily solved by searching for gaps in my knowledge.
